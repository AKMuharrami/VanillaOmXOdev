        In a fantasy world completely different than ours, the tale of “Asad” (literally means Lion in Arabic) takes place,
        </p>
        <p> <br></br>
         a youngster unlike other youngsters in his age, rather unlike the prominent population of his time, in his ambitions, concerns, and by what resulted of behavior and actions. As destiny willed for him to lose his father from a young age, as such he doesn’t remember from his time with his father except small fragments. Though with how small the fragmented memories are, they have a deep effect on his heart. Due to what they contained in them. Memories of sacrifice, abidance by the truth, staying true to one’s words, remembering the benevolence of others, prioritizing others over one’s self, and absolute wariness of all that which is considered evil etc. He strives forward following his father’s footsteps, not that he is following them blindly due to the blood bond he has with his father. Rather due to what they contained of prevailing truth and glazing ideology that deserve to prevail and be shared.
        </p>
        <p> <br></br>
        “HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I, after so many years of immense calculations, careful proceeding, and encompassment of all that which is required to reign, have been betrayed by my most favored disciple, what an utter disgrace.
        
        O God, I have strived for the glory of your religion, the glory of your servants, countless people have, over the years, placed their hopes on me. I have taken by all the reasons to ensure a smooth execution. So why do this to me?”
        
        Tears began flowing slowly from the man’s eyes. It be known that he for a long time hasn’t shed a single tear. 
        
        Why? 

        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        Suddenly the sound of approaching footsteps could be heard.
        
        “Leave my sister alone you bandits!”
        
        “Oi kid, don’t force our hands, just tell us where she is hiding, and we will let you off”
        
        Soon the silhouettes of the approaching began to clear up.
        
        </p> <br></br> <p>
        Sensing a person close, they turned their gazes onto him only to turn them away moments later.
        
        Just seeing the desperate and dire state of the man was enough for them to leave him alone.
        
        Crying whilst laying down on the ground on a rainy day, in the middle of a forest, how desperate can he be? 
        
        </p><br></br>
        <p>
        Not to mention the deep wound on his back. Seeing the amount of gushing blood, the man was more or less a goner.
        
        “This kid has been refusing our benevolence for hours, what to do now?”
        
        “The boss demanded we finish the mission before dawn. And given the boss’s temperament, I’m afraid that we will not be let off easily. 
        
        “Ahhh, this kid can only blame his own foolishness, we’ll have to proceed with the torture.”
        
        As soon as his words ended, the man threw the child into the ground, holding the sword inches away from his neck. 
        
        “Speak, where is your sister hiding?”

        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        But the boy contrary to what these bandits expected, didn’t even flinch at the sight of the sword. 
        
        Rather he seemed determined to die in protection of his own sister.
        
        As if easing himself of anger and frustration the man started kicking the young kid left and right.
        
        “Why?
        
        Why?”
        
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “If I die, I die as a martyr, what is there to lose?” the kid stated
        
        “No, why is such a pious kid such as you, ready to throw your life away for such ‘filthy’ sister? It can’t be that you don’t know of the bad that she commits?”
        
        Saving yourself for the sake of glorifying and reviving your people’s glory seems to be the appropriate action.
        
        Just look at you! With how young you are yet you are the epitome of hope, countless have witnessed your conduct and countless have witnessed your determination. So why throw it all away for the sake of a person who pays no heed and respect for the commandments of your God? 
        </p> <br></br> <p>
        As if this question sparked the interest of the crying wounded man, he shifted his gaze to the scene occurring close to him.
        
        He too, was interested in knowing the answer. 
        
        “This life is but a mere trial, if my efforts don’t bear fruit then I regret not as they have been saved for me. For whomever walks into a path seeking the Almighty (… and is then overtaken by death, then his reward is incumbent on Allah). 
        
        Not to mention that I possess no knowledge of the future, and as it is said “The deciding factors are the endings”. Who knows whether if I live today sacrificing my sister I’ll reach my goals, who knows? Perhaps she will live and out of her womb would come out he who would successfully achieve this ultimate goal. How can I, even though I only exist because of the Most High, have the arrogance to believe the my life is better than hers?
        
        Not to mentions that I am but a slave to God, how audacious can I be to throw away his commandments for the sake of saving myself, and then I claim that I want glory for the religion, glory for the servants of him! Know that that which is in the hands of Allah is not sought after except through his obedience.
        
        Then again, the glory of the religion is but for Allah to decide upon. We are mere vessels, if we were fortunate enough to be the carriers of such tasks then we’re naturally upon a precious journey in which we have to be grateful for. Else, “the intent of the believer is better than his actions", and that is enough for us to be at ease.”
        
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        This is it
        This is it
        
        I have lost my heart 
        
        How foolish, how foolish!
        
        I may have reached far but my heart has been lost along the way.
        
        How many ‘pawns’ have I sacrificed, how many comrades have I sent to their doom, how many promises have I broken! Ah Ha ha ha ha ha! How will I dare face their faces ever again.. in the hereafter…
        
        How many sins have I committed. O soul, O dear soul, who are you fooling? 
        
        You were so immersed in the act of self-satisfaction and instant gratification, that you lost your initial purpose. Else what explains all of that?
        
         </p>
         <br></br>
        <p>
        As the man was deeply immersed in his thoughts he forgot all that was going around him.
        
        Only to awaken later to a scene where the young boy’s nails were forcibly removed.   
        
        Hearing the cry’s of the young man, the deprssesed man immediately went to action.
        
        “I only have enough strength to end these three, I can only hope that the kid is smart enough to quickly tend to my wounds”
        
        Speaking to himself the man, picked up three stones from the ground, and with three consecutive flicks the three men fell to ground, their hearts pierced. 
        
        Feeling the torture has stopped, the young boy in difficulty opened his eyes. Only to be stupefied at the difficult-to-explain sight in front of him.
        
        Glancing around, looking at the stones and the angle of the wounds. The only suspect was the crying-man who appeared to have fainted.
        
        “Could this be one of those legendary martial artists that my father once mentioned?
        
        Ahh, there is no time to speculate now, I have to quickly take him to my sister to save his life. 
        
        Following the tracks left behind in the muddy footsteps, the boy eventually came close to what seemed like a small village.
